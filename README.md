# About Me

Hello! My name is Arshia, also known online as ItzMrRatsP. While I do not currently hold a formal school or college degree, I am highly motivated to pursue academic qualifications in English and Teaching to support my passion for education and communication.

I bring over four years of experience in scripting on Roblox, along with two additional years working across other platforms, giving me a solid foundation in game development and programming. During this time, I’ve also gained a strong interest in mentoring and instructional design.

I have been mentored for over two years by the highly respected educator and developer, DylWithIt, whose guidance has played a key role in my growth and development. I am now eager to build on this experience by formalizing my skills through education and sharing what I’ve learned with others.
